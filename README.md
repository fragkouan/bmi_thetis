# bmi_thetis

In order for this to run, the Thetis version (https://github.com/fragkouan/thetis_wci) should be "installed". <br />
Then the Python bindings of BMI should also be installed (https://github.com/csdms/bmi-python)

The contents of this repository can then be copied into the machine in order to carry out a simple Thetis configuration from a steering file, or the couple Thetis with SWAN.
